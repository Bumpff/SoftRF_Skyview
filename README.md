# SoftRF_Skyview

This repository is my C++ learning exercise and a work in progress.  Note - I'm very new to GitHub and C++ programming so my code may be messy.

Since I'm a sailplane pilot, my first project is exploring and tinkering with the SoftRF (originated by Lyusupov) Skyview EZ device.  

The starting point for this code was Moshe revision M06b which I think is based upon Lyusupov revision 0.12.  (Note Lyusupov revision 0.13 introduced a screen rotation selector which rotates 180 degrees but not landscape).

I have set myself the following goals:
1.  Enable the radar and text screens to display in landscape view with a selector in the web interface.  Achieved, but needs tidy up.
2.  Develop an additional screen with navigation information for tug retrieves.

Landscape mode (battery text box is showing my trial data, not battery voltage or %)
